# StockPricePuzzle

This is my solution to a testing question.

The objective of the puzzle is to read in a list of stock prices indexed by time and return the maximum possible profit from buying at one price and selling at a later price.

My solution is not optimal because this problem can be solved in linear time. I'll update it when I figure out how to accomplish this.

//Update 11/23/2016: After more research I found a way to perform the function in linear time and corrected a major error that caused the //buy and sell values to be reversed.
